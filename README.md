# Blueberry Project Sandbox

Welcome to the Blueberry Project Sandbox! Feel free to mess around here. It's okay if you make a mistake, because the main stuff is on another branch.


## Project Overview

The Blueberry Project focuses on developing a game that leverages data analytics and machine learning to create dynamic and engaging gameplay. Our goal is to create a user-friendly interface that allows players to interact with the game in a meaningful way.

## Features we're planning

- **Data Visualisation**: Interactive charts and graphs to help players understand game statistics.
- **Leaderboards**: Real-time leaderboards to track player rankings and achievements.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Adaptive gameplay that evolves based on player behavior.
- **User Management**: Secure authentication and player profile management.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Blueberry Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/babafun/BlueberryProject.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd BlueberryProject`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

Or use GitHub Desktop (much easier, doesn't require Node.js npm)!

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Make sure to follow our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Play

To play the Blueberry Project game, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org][python].
2. Find the folder in this repository called ".start".
3. Run the respective "start-server" file in the ".start" folder (for Windows, that's `start-server.bat`, not `local-server-manager-windows.ps1`). [(why?)][explanation]
It should automatically open the game on your default browser. Enjoy your gaming experience!
