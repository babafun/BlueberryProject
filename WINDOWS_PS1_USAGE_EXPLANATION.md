# Windows PowerShell Script Usage Explanation

## Overview

This document explains the purpose and usage of the **.ps1** script provided in this project. Unlike traditional **.bat** files, the **.ps1** script is designed to harness the full capabilities of your PC by utilising a more complex algorithm that cannot be reliably implemented in a regular batch file.

## Why Use a .ps1 Script?

- **Advanced Functionality:**  
  The **.ps1** script leverages Windows PowerShell to execute a complex algorithm which requires capabilities beyond what is typically possible with **.bat** files.

- **Enhanced System Integration:**  
  PowerShell scripts have deep integration with the Windows operating system, allowing them to access system resources and perform operations that a simple batch file cannot.

## Key Points

- **Complex Algorithm:**  
  The script is built to execute a complex algorithm that adapts to the resources available on your computer.

- **Resource Utilisation:**  
  It intelligently uses your PC's current resources to ensure optimised performance—something that regular **.bat** files simply cannot achieve.

- **Improved Reliability and Flexibility:**  
  With PowerShell, you gain enhanced error handling and scripting capabilities, resulting in a more robust solution.

## Conclusion

By using the **.ps1** script, you gain access to **cutting-edge functionality** and **system integration** that will enable your PC to perform advanced tasks which are otherwise unachievable with a standard batch file. This makes it the ideal choice for executing the complex algorithm designed for this project.
